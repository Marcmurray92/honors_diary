__First Group Meeting__ 

This week we had our first group meeting regarding the honors project, and we all proposed our ideas.
Mine was far too broad, I was hoping to do a study on the Software as a Service (SAAS) business model.



__Initial Research__

After the meeting I had to think of a new idea, and 

 

* Idea Formulation

  * What I want to specialize in is front end development for interactive web applications, and need to find a way to work this into my project. 

        
  * In researching the best packages for creating single page applications, I decided on AngularJS.

        
  * In researching various frameworks for CSS and responsive pages/applications, I am currently stuck between Bootstrap and Bourbon Neat.


__Bootstrap__
* Advantages:
  * Industry standard
  * Plenty of learning resources available
  
* Disadvantages:
  * Gratuitous use of class names means the page markup can be bloated and difficult to read.

__Bourbon Neat__
* Advantages:
  * Uses SASS natively
  * SASS based grid system makes use of mixing rather than classnames
  * Geared more towards semantic and clean markup
  
*Disadvantages:
  * Not nearly as many learning resources available
  * Emailed facilitator with new idea.



- Further Research
- I read more in depth  



- Learning contract draft

 
 
2. Week 2
 

    This week I solidified my idea more. Facilitator feedback was instrumental in this and I managed to put together a much more detailed learning contract draft. My task for this week is to await further feedback, make the correct changes and then condensing the information to 2 pages.

    Some titles I looked at when creating the new learning contract draft were as follows:
        Investigating the effect of contextual interfaces on usability on web applications.
        The impact of contextual animation on usability in web interfaces.
    Decided on 
    Created user flows and wireframes for test environments.
